Project: *Programming Network Stack for Middleboxes with Rubik*
  * Designed Rubik, a domain-specific language for the middlebox stack, which decreases coding efforts for building a TCP/IP stack by two orders of magnitude (e.g.from 20,000 lines to 300 lines).

  * Prototyped the compiler of Rubik and built various realistic cases using Rubik language, including 12 reusable protocol parsers, 4 network stacks, and 3 open-source middleboxes.

  * Conducted optimizations in the IR and the backend of the compiler for improving the processing throughput, *e.g.*, the TCP/IP stack built on Rubik outperformed state-of-the-art by 23%.
