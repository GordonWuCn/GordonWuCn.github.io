## Video Games
I am really a big fan of GBA, NDS, Wii, Xbox and PC games. Though my parents 
think games are just entertainments (a.k.a., waste of time), I consider game 
playing a significant role in my personal development. They give me different 
perspectives about how I can think about the world. I can encounter fictional 
creatures, cast magic and trade as a billionaire in games, which enrich my 
imagination. And games trained my initial computer science skills, e.g.,
config routers or solving dynamic linking problem :)
